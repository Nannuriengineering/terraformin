dependecies:
----------------------
1.implicit dependices
2.explicit dependecies

  we will use depends on for explicit dependcy.if you explicitly defning here it has to create after something has been created.
  
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/depends_on.html

every resource code contain 

  1.arugumnet reference:
  ------------------------
     if you want craete any resource what all inputs you can use is called argument reference( at the timr of creating the resource)
        
     
  2.attribute reference:
  ---------------------------
   after creating any resource it will export somethings.if you want use
   
   
   if apply destroy it is going destroy all the infrastructure what you created.if you want destroy everything except some bucket or any resource then that from the tfstate file and 
   comment out that code.
   
   terraform state list----it will show all it has created
   
   terraform state
   
   terraform state rm <any resource name that you want to keep>
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   
   everry resource has contain two things
   
    1.resource
    2.data source
    
    if you already created any vpc without terraform if you want create subnets with help of terraforrm use datasource.
    
    if yoy have two var files one is terraform.tfvarrs and prod.tfvars.so you have keep two state files,otherwise it will go override the already exsited infrastructure.
    
    to solve this problem we will use workspaces.
    
    terraform workspace---------it will show all the aruguments.
    terraform workspace list---it will show all workspaces
    terraform workspace new prod---------to create a new workspace
    terraform workspace new dev
    terraform workspace select <name of the workspace>---------------to go to particular namespace.
    terraform workspace delete <name of the workspace>
